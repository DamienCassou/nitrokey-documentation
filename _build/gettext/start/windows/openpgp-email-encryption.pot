msgid "If you already have OpenPGP keys you may want to use them with your  Nitrokey, instead of generating new ones. Importing exsiting keys works  basically the same as generating keys locally first and copy them to the Nitrokey (see above). Therefore, please have a look at the corresponding instructions. Note that you probably want to generate another subkey for  authentication to your existing key. See at the same instructions for subkey generation."
