"The use of One-time Passwords (OTP) is called very differently on the "
"various services supporting it. Sometimes it is referred to as Multi-"
"factor Authentication (MFA), sometimes it is Two-factor Authentication "
"(2FA) or just \"authentication via authenticator app\" like Google "
"Authenticator. Most of these services are compatible for usage with the "
"Nitrokey Pro and Nitrokey Storage. The following instructions show how to"
" enable OTP on our support forum. The procedure is quite similar on most "
"services. For a list of websites supporting OTP have a look at "
"dongleauth.info."
