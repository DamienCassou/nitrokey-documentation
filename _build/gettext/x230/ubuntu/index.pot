msgid "With the NitroPad X230, malicious changes to the BIOS, operating system, and software can be easily detected. For example, if you left your NitroPad in a hotel room, you can use your Nitrokey to check if it has been tampered with while you were away. If an attacker modifies the NitroPad's firmware or operating system, the Nitrokey will detect this (instructions below)."

msgid "The box marked in red contains the information that the BIOS has not been changed and that the shared secret of the NitroPad and the Nitrokey match. But this information is not sufficient, because an attacker could have faked it. If at the same time the Nitrokey also flashes green, everything is fine. An attacker would have to have had access to the NitroPad and Nitrokey to achieve this result. It is therefore important that you do not leave both devices unattended."
