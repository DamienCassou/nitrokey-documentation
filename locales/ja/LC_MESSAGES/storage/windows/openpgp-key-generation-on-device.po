"The following instructions explain the generation of OpenPGP keys "
"directly on the Nitrokey. This is done by using the command line "
"interface of GnuPG. Thus, you need to have GnuPG installed on your "
"system. The newest GnuPG version for Windows can be found here and the "
"newest version for MacOS can be found here. Users of Linux systems please"
" install GnuPG with help of the package manager."

"Please do not create the suggested off-card backup. This \"backup\" does "
"only save the encryption key, but not the signature and authentication "
"keys. In case of a loss of the device, you will not be able to restore "
"the whole key set. So on the one hand it is no full backup (use these "
"instructions instead, if you need one) and on the other hand you risk "
"that someone else can get in possession of your encryption key. The "
"advantage of generating keys on-device is to make sure that keys are "
