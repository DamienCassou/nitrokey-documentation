"The secure access to such a central software is especially important and "
"can now be realized with the Nitrokey. For this purpose, access is "
"protected by two-factor authentication (2FA) and critical users are given"
" a Nitrokey. From now on the Nitrokey will be checked during user login "
"in addition to the user password. Phishing attacks are thus foiled and "
"your critical company data is protected."

"The two-factor authentication can be carried out using one-time passwords"
" (TOTP, RFC 6238) and FIDO U2F, thus enabling Nitrokey Pro, Nitrokey "
"Storage and Nitrokey FIDO U2F to be used. It is also possible to "
"configure authentication centrally and to activate it only for selected "
"users."
