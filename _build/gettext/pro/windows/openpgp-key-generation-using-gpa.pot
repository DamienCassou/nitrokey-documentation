msgid "The following instructions explain the generation of OpenPGP keys directly on the Nitrokey with help of the GNU Privacy Assistant (GPA). You won't be able to create a backup of these keys. Thus, if you lose the Nitrokey or it breaks you can not decrypt mails or use these keys anymore. Please see here for a comparison of the different methods to generate OpenPGP keys."

Users of Linux systems please install GnuPG and GPA with help of the package manager (e.g. using sudo apt install gnupg gpa on Ubuntu)."

msgid "Please do not use the backup checkbox. This \"backup\" does only save the encryption key. In case of a loss of the device, you will not be able to restore the whole key set. So on the one hand it is no full backup (use these instructions instead, if you need one) and on the other hand you risk that someone else can get in possession of your encryption key. The advantage of generating keys on-device is to make sure that keys are stored securely. Therefore, we recommend to skip this half-backup."
