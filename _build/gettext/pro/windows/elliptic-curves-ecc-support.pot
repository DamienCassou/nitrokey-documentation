msgid "For security reasons, the German Federal Office for Information  Security (Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik, BSI) no  longer recommends RSA keys with a length of 2048 bit to be used after 2022. This means that longer keys will need to come into use in the  foreseeable future. Assuming a usage period of five years, is is already necessary to generate longer keys. However, longer RSA keys with 3072  bit or 4096 bit are significantly slower. For this reason the new  Nitrokey Storage 2 and Pro 2 (resp. the integrated OpenPGP Card version  3.3) supports encryption by means of elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC). This method is considered to be just as secure with smaller ECC keys as longer RSA keys and is also considerably faster."

msgid "In contrast to RSA, there are many different forms (so-called curves) of elliptic-curve cryptography. Notably, the NSA was involved in the development of the NIST curves. Even if there is no evidence of  back doors in the curves, using a certain curve can pose a question of  trust. Fortunately the new Nitrokey Storage 2 and Pro 2 support two kind of curves, namely NIST and Brainpool. In what follows we will use  Brainpool curves. This article provides a good entry point for gaining a general understanding of elliptic-curve cryptography."

The newest GnuPG  version for Windows can be found here and the newest version for MacOS can be found here. A suitable version of GnuPG is included in the GNU/Linux distributions  Ubuntu (since 18.04), Debian (from Stretch onwards), Arch Linux, Fedora  (from Release 26 onwards) and openSUSE Tumbleweed. At the end of this  articles are instructions how to manually update GnuPG on older Ubuntu  versions."

All communication partners must use GnuPG 2.1 or newer for email encryption by means of ECC, otherwise incompatibility  issues might arise. Therefore you should only use ECC if you are sure  you will be able to circumvent this problem. :::"

msgid "Once these requirements are fulfilled, you can get started. (Warning: existing keys will be overwritten in the process!) You now have two options. The first option is to create the key  directly on the Nitrokey Storage 2 / Pro 2. The benefit here is that the key will never be outside the device and as such can never be read out. The second option is to import a previously locally generated key. The  advantage in this case is that you can securely store a backup of the  key, which can then be restored in case the Nitrokey is lost. Only the  first option is described below. In order to create a key with backup,  you can access the following instructions and use this general information to transfer the key to the Nitrokey."
