"For security reasons, the German Federal Office for Information Security "
"(Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik or BSI) no longer "
"recommends RSA keys with a length of 2048 bit be used after 2022. This "
"means that longer keys will need to come into use in the foreseeable "
"future. Assuming a period of use of five years, safer keys should already"
" be being generated. However, longer RSA keys with 3072 bit or 4096 bit "
"are significantly slower. For this reason Nitrokey Start (resp. the "
"underlying firmware Gnuk) has been supporting encryption by means of "
"elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC) for some time. This method is "
"considered to be just as secure for smaller key systems as longer RSA "
"keys and is also considerably faster."

"In contrast to RSA, there are many different forms (so-called curves) of "
"elliptic-curve cryptography. Notably, the NSA was involved in the "
"development of the NIST curves. Even if there is no evidence of back "
"doors in the curves, using a certain curve can pose a question of trust. "
"Fortunately the Nitrokey Start supports multiple curves, namely NIST, "
"SECG and Curve25519. In what follows we will use Curve25519 and Ed25519 "
"that is based upon this, both of which have a good reputation and are "
"considered to be secure. This article provides a good entry point for "
"gaining a general understanding of elliptic-curve cryptography."

"You can learn about the installed version of GnuPG via ‘gpg2 --version’. "
"At least version 2.1.16 is required. The newest GnuPG version for Windows"
" can be found here and the newest version for MacOS can be found here. A "
"suitable version of GnuPG is included in the GNU/Linux distributions "
"Debian (from Stretch onwards), Arch Linux, Fedora (from Release 26 "
"onwards) and openSUSE Tumbleweed. Unfortunately only GnuPG 2.1.15 is "
"currently included in the latest release of Ubuntu (17.10) and use is "
"therefore currently not readily possible. At the end of this articles are"

"Important: GnuPG 2.0 is still being used, but support for it will run out"
" around the end of 2017. All communication partners must use GnuPG 2.1 or"
" newer for email encryption by means of ECC, otherwise incompatibility "
"issues might arise. Therefore you should only use ECC if you are sure you"
" will be able to circumvent this problem."

"Once these requirements are fulfilled, you can get started. (Warning: "
"existing keys will be overwritten in the process!) You now have two "
"options. The first option is to create the key directly on the Nitrokey "
"Start. The benefit here is that the key will never be outside the device "
"and as such can never be read out. The second option is to import a "
"previously locally generated key. The advantage in this case is that you "
"can securely store a backup of the key, which can then be restored in "
"case the Nitrokey is lost. Only the first option is described below. In "
"order to create a key with backup, you can access the following "
"instructions and use this general information to transfer the key to the "
"Nitrokey."

"Within GnuPG there is already a ‘generate’ command, which can be used to "
"easily create keys on the device. (Update 20.11.2017: With GnuPG 2.2.2 "
"and higher, during \"generate\" command you can enter the keysize "
"\"25519\" to select Curve25519. In this case you can skip the following "
"lines.) However it is not as yet possible to select the type of key "
"directly, so the key must first be prepared. We use the following "
