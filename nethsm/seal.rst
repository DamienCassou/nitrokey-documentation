Dealing with Sealing
====================

To verify that your NetSHM has arrived safely you should check the following things:

- The packaging for any tears, cuts or holes.
- The seals for any broken seals

If you notice any changes or have an uneasy feeling, contact our support team at support@nitrokey.com.

Here are some pictures of a NetHSM after sealing and before shipping:
